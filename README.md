Welcome screens are as important as the other features of any app. They enhance the user experience of an app. You can use them to create a great intro screen slider.

And after knowing all this, I thought to create a demo on it and written a tutorial to [make intro screen slider in Android Viewpager with page transformer animation](https://www.spaceotechnologies.com/make-android-viewpager-intro-screen-page-transformer-animation/).
